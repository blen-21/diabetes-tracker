        <h1>What Is Diabetes?</h1>
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should.</p>
        
        <h1>Types Of Diabetes</h1>
        <h3>Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This type often develops in children and young adults.</p>
        
        <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops producing enough insulin. It's the most common type and is often linked to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
        
        <h3>Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <p>Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears after giving birth, but it increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later.</p>
        
        <h1>Symptoms Of Diabetes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased thirst</li>
            <li>Frequent urination</li>
            <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Slow-healing sores</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Causes And Risk Factors</h1>
        <p>Diabetes is caused by the body's inability to produce or use insulin effectively. The exact cause depends on the type of diabetes. Risk factors include obesity, age, family history, high blood pressure, and an inactive lifestyle.</p>
        
        <h1>How Is Diabetes Diagnosed?</h1>
        <p>Diabetes is typically diagnosed through blood tests that measure blood sugar levels. Common tests include the fasting blood sugar test, A1C test, and oral glucose tolerance test.</p>
        
        <h1>Managing And Treating Diabetes</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Lifestyle Changes: Healthy eating, regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight are key to managing diabetes.</li>
            <li>Medication: Depending on the type of diabetes, medications such as insulin injections or oral drugs may be necessary.</li>
            <li>Monitoring: Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is crucial for managing diabetes effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h1>Complications Of Diabetes</h1>
        <p>Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious complications, including heart disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, and vision loss.</p>
        
        <h1>Prevention Tips</h1>
        <p>To lower your risk of diabetes, maintain a healthy weight, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking.</p>
