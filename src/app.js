        {
            question: "Can stress affect my blood sugar levels?",
            answer: "Yes, stress can raise blood sugar levels by causing the body to release hormones like cortisol, which can interfere with insulin."
        },
        {
            question: "What is insulin resistance?",
            answer: "Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, making it harder for glucose to enter the cells, which can lead to elevated blood sugar levels."
        },
        {
            question: "What is hypoglycemia?",
            answer: "Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, occurs when your blood glucose drops below 70 mg/dL. It can cause symptoms like shakiness, sweating, confusion, and dizziness."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I treat hypoglycemia?",
